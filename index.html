I am a software engineering developer and leed with experience spanning a range of diverse fields such as desktop apps, cloud, data backups, data processing and encryption, AI, computer-aided design and manufacturing, software verification.

I enjoy solving hard problems that have real impact, whether that involves writing code, or great documents, or delivering through others. When working in teams, I find important areas that no one is working on, and focus on those.

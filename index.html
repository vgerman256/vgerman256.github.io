                        I am a software engineering developer and leed with experience spanning a range of diverse
                        fields such as desktop apps, cloud, data backups, data processing and encryption, AI,
                        computer-aided design and
                        manufacturing, software verification.

                    <p>
                        I enjoy solving hard problems that have real impact, whether that involves writing code, or
                        great documents, or
                        delivering through others. When working in teams, I find important areas that no one is working
                        on, and focus on those.

                        I live in Szczecin, Poland/EU, with my family. In my spare time, I read up on 
                        AI/ML and distributed systems, solve random math problems, fitness and skiing, and indulge in the ancient
                        strategy board game of Chess.

                        I obtained my Masters degree in Computer science from the ISU university of Kyiv in 2000. In
                        scope of doctoral degree involved in R&amp;D project in Software Verification fileds in the
